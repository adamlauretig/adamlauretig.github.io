      <description>Introduction Iâ€™ve recently become interested in factorization machines, a flexible augmentation of regression, which assumes the interactions between two variables factorizes into a low-rank matrix, the coefficient on the interaction is the result of a dot-product on latent factors. This structure regularizes coefficients, allows for non-linear higher-order interactions, and is computationally cheap to compute. It is a flexible, scalable, and interpretable model, useful for a variety of applications.
However, resources for learning about and implementing factorization machines in R are scant, and resources for learning about and implementing Bayesian factorization machines even more so.</description>
