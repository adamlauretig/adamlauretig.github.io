# Biography

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at The Ohio State University, with a focus on political methodology and foreign policy decision-making. In my dissertation, I develop a new model, the Structural Bayesian Document Embedding, which allows us to investigate the effect of metadata on the meaning of individual words. I also propose an inference strategy to return interpretable estimates of the effect of covariates on meaning. I use this model to investigate the determinants of threat perception during the Cold War among elites, drawing on the recently digitized *Foreign Relations of the United States.*
